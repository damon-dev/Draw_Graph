# Draw_Graph
Simple graph constructor and algorithm visualiser.

#Controls:

Left Click on Empty -> Create New Node

Left Click on Node  -> Move Node (delete if released out of boundaries)/Start Animation

Double Click Node   -> Edit Content

Right Click on Node -> Create Edge (has to connect 2 different nodes)

Overlap 2 Edges     -> Delete Edge

Everything else is straightforward (I guess).
